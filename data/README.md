directory structure should be as follows:


```
/data/
|__ CVfolds
|__ paper_results
|__ sample
|   |__ features/phoenix_Signer03_deephand
|   |__ results
|   |   |__ clus
```


you may need to move the files one level up after unzipping, depending on where you extract.


The features that are downloaded via Google Drive should be in this structure:
```
/features/
|__ deep_hand
|   |__ c3/right/train
|   |__ c3/left/train
|__ deep_hand_PCA40W
|   |__ c3/right/train
|   |__ c3/left/train
|__ op_body
|__ op_face
|__ op_hand
|   |__ left
|   |__ right
```
