# TermDiscovery KNN

This repository contains the code of KNN based term discovery algorithm, implemented for our paper  [Unsupervised discovery of sign terms by K-nearest neighbours approach (ECCV '20)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66096-3_22  "Link to paper"). 

This repo is intended for general purpose term (motif) disvovery. Given a set of feature vector time series, the algorithm outputs pairs of similar segments. 

This implementation closely follows the original algorithm that is proposed by Thual et. al. in [A K-nearest neighbours approach to unsupervised spoken term discovery](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01947953).
